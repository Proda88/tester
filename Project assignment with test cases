To complete project, following site should be used:
• For UI: https://www.saucedemo.com/
• For API: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

Part 1 – Selenium:
• Using xUnit as test runner and Selenium, create a new project called SauceDemo.Test
• Create directory – POM
• Write test for Successful user login and test for failed login. For failed login execute test with at
least 3 different invalid username/password combinations.
• Once user is successfully logged in, add following 3 products to the basket: Backpack,
BikeLight and TShit. Check if the right number of items has been added to the basket.
• Navigate to the basket and remove all 3 items that have been previously added. Check if
basket is empty and go back to shopping after that.

Part 2 – REST APIs:
• Using xUnit as runner and RestSharp as library create a new project
• Write statusCode tests for following endpoints:
• GET: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
• GET: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments
• GET: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos
• GET: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments?postId=1
• For all 4 end points, check if content returned is not empty
• Deserialize json body for last endpoint (postId=1) and check number of comments returned for
this postId

Part 3 – Test cases:
• For each test that you automate, create appropriate test case (in any test management tool
such as TestRail or even in Word or Notepad)
